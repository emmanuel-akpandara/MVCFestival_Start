#  MVC Festival Management System

This is a learning-oriented project built with ASP.NET MVC that simulates a basic festival/event management system. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern and showcases key concepts such as routing, form handling, model binding, data validation, and views using Razor.

##  Features

-  View a list of upcoming festivals and events
-  Add, edit, and delete festival entries
-  Capture details like date, location, title, and description
-  Server-side validation for form inputs
-  Strong grasp of MVC conventions, separation of concerns, and Razor syntax

##  Technologies Used

- ASP.NET MVC 5
- C#
- Razor Views
- HTML/CSS (Bootstrap for styling)
- Visual Studio

##  What I Learned

- The structure and flow of ASP.NET MVC applications
- Routing and URL pattern mapping
- Using ViewModels to pass data between controllers and views
- Strongly typed views and model binding
- CRUD operations using in-memory data (or optionally connected to a database)
- Implementing server-side form validation with Data Annotations
